# Learning in exponential times - how to adapt our education systems to our world challenges
Margaux Pelen

## Drive change in adult education

Content access is growing exponentionally, but delivery is mostly the same (youtube example)
Youtube has so many tutorials and ways to learn new things.

Same education system for almost 200y, but the job market has changed

### 45% of tasks will be automated
Not jobs, but tasks.
Your job can change but will not go away.
So you need to grow with it as well


### Classical patterns
We're not staying at the smae job or company anymore

> Learning is the new gym

## Education is failing learners
- Negative return on investment
- 45 % of US workers are freelance
- 21% make 100K
- ...

## Solutions
New tools to monitor opportunities.
This allows to know the subjects to focus on.

### redefine 'higher education'

Companies are becoming campuses.
They have to (re)train their workers.

### Learn from the past
Come together on bigger projects. 
Learn from people with experience.

Just like guilds :)

Coworking communities are an example of this.
Also online, via slack for example.

## Recap
- Exclusive tranings for those who don't want to be hired
- Currently hired need internal training
- specific training for those who want to be hired (?)

## Questions
> What to say to minister of edu in France?

Allow people to use technology in the classroom. 
Phones are not allowed since recently anymore.
They should embrace it, in a positive way.

> Are we moving to a craftman job situation

We're changing to more a portfolio structure instead of staying at one company.

People with the most interesting jobs mostly come from different backgrounds.
