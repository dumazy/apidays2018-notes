# Just a spoonful of Agile to make transformations go down

## Tools
Sometimes tools should be skipped,
other tools should be considered
or tools should be used better.

## Trasnfomation disorders

### What can go wrong
- People don't want to change.
- No time for change (automated testing)

Questions & issues:

- What's my return on investment
- sunk costs fallacy
- 100% sure of this
- trying to do all at once

## Agile transformation
> Agility is a mindset. It takes a pragmatic approach to solving the real problems hindering the production of value

### What makes a project agile
- prioritized backlog
- mvp
- interactions
- feedback loops
- self-organizing
- focus on value 
- WIP limits
- trial and error

> error is a part of the progress as well

Not only short term but long term problems are handled.

### Requirements
- What kind of transformation? (agile, api, devops ,cloud , containers, blockchain)
- what scope? (team, product, department...)
- Why? -> very important to ask this one first
- what investment can we make? (time, effort, etc...)
- What will we tell the client?

### first steps

#### prioritized backlog
- we believe that *this* change
- will result in *this* outcome
- we will know we are successful when we observe *this* measurable signal

example:

- Automated integration pipeline
- agile facitilitators
- devops design
- k8s poc

#### loop the loop
- take
- target
- track
- loop (?)

#### Avoid pitfalls
Don't wait!

We're all in the same boat. (devs, ops, biz, managers)

It takes time for people to change
- pick battles
- dont be hasty to cry victory (wait for errors)

Celebrate each win

Get outside help; sometimes easier to hear from somebody who's not oppionated

## Summery
- invigorate with quick wins
- tolerate
- illuminate
